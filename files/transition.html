      <h1>Visit for Transition</h1>
      <p>
        This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates.
        This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.
      <br>
      <br>
        The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
      </p>

      <h1>Extra Help for Students</h1>
      <p>
        The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’ needs.
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
        <br>
        <br><strong>
        • Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence
        <br>
        • Offering more opportunities for exploration
        <br>
        • Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
        <br>
        • Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
        <br>
        • Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
        order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
        <br>
        • Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
        concept, skill, or area of concerns.</strong>
        <br>
       <br>
       Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
       child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.

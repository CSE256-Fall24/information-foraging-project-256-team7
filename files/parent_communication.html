    <h1>Parent-School Communication</h1>
    <p>
      Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.

        Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. 
        Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. 
        Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.

        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. 
      </h4>

      <br>
      <p>
        The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. 
        The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.

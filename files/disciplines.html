      <h1>Discipline at WUNS</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.

        How we approach discipline?	
      </h2>
      <h3>
        <br>
        Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learnanddevelopskillsthattheyneedtodisplayappropriatebehavior. This is done through:	
        Positive reinforcement.
                     
        - Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.
                     
        - Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.
                     
       -  Naming and validating childâ€™s feelings
                     
        - Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.
                     
        - Simple, logical and immediate consequences
